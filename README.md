# alcohol
Practice exercise in python for the PITDS23 course.
100% reproducible.
This Python exercise will explore hospital stays due to alcohol-related health conditions using open data from Public Health Scotland. The data will be analyzed by sex to explore differences in the use of hospital resources by men and women. This information could be used to implement prevention policies that target men and women differently.
